# 🎮 Reinforcement Learning Projects

This repository contains reinforcement learning agents built and trained using Google Colab notebooks. Projects include agents for environments like **Taxi-v3** and **Super Mario Bros**, using deep Q-learning techniques.

---

## 🚀 Overview

These projects demonstrate how reinforcement learning can be applied to game-like environments to learn optimal behavior through trial and error. Each notebook includes training, evaluation, and optional gameplay visualization.
